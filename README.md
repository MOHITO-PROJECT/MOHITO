__MOHITO – Model-driven homogenized data storage and synchronization with predictable properties for cross-platform application__

The MOHITO project targets the challenge to enable multi-platform development of distributed applications. The term multi-platform summarizes various server-side frameworks (e.g. JavaEE, Spring, CAS Open), mobile operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), and desktop systems as well as browsers. 

Today, application developers and software vendors are typically confronted with the necessity to implement one application for a large number of popular (mobile) target platforms plus a server-side part. Due to economic constraints, development must be cost-efficient while meeting high demands in terms of quality. 

The strategy of MOHITO is to replace the manual coding of platform-specific data layers for all target platforms of a multi-platform application by a model-driven approach that generates this code from exactly one data model. The use of one model for all target platforms greatly simplifies data model maintenance over the whole lifecycle and provides for consistency among the platform-specific versions. Code generation also helps to reduce the number of coding errors. The generated data layers may be used for stand-alone applications as well as in distributed systems.

In MOHITO, code is generated against the MOHITO runtime framework. Apart from access to local data (e.g. a local database) and remote data sources (e.g. via the REST interface of an application server), the framework provides support for offline access to server data on the client side, caching of server data on the client side, and synchronization mechanisms between client and server out of the box.
